# Educational Technology Plan

This plan is going to describe the necessary hardware, software and course objectives for a proposed course in computer science and coding principles.

## Context

### Course

**AP Computer Science**

This AP Computer Science course introduces the concepts and tools of computer science.  Students will learn principles of computer science as well as design, write and test programs using the programming language Java, to solve problems and create new tools.  This course will prepare students for the AP Computer Science A exam.

This is an elective course and is open to students in 10-12th grade who have passed Integrated Math 1 with a C- or better.

### Situation

This class will be provided as an elective and class size will depend on interest 
from students.  Class size can be up to 36 students under normal circumstances.  
Our school does not have the funds to support any additional purchases for this 
class to begin, so the options will either be to use existing technology or to apply 
for a grant.  Every student has been issued a Chromebook and while class could be held
in a lab, software would need to run on Chromebooks to make sure students were able 
to access it from home.
This course will have a "class within a class" where students will be able to learn 
computer science principles at a lower level, without intending to take the AP test.

## Plan

### Software Specifications

Describe the software that you will use. Include software used for students as
well as any software the instructor will use. This should include any software
installed as well as any online services.

### Hardware Specifications

Describe the hardware requirements for your class. Provide specific requirements
wherever necessary.

### Application

Describe how you will use the above technologies in the class, including
in-class activities, homework, assignments, and assessment. Justify the use
in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, evidence-based and inclusive pedagogy.

### Impacts

How will the technology help *all* students learn? In this section, you can also
describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or
evolving course contexts.
