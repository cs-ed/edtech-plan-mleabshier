# Educational Technology Plan

This plan is going to describe the necessary hardware, software and course objectives for a proposed course in computer science and coding principles.

## Context

### Course

**AP Computer Science**

This AP Computer Science course introduces the concepts and tools of computer science.  Students will learn principles of computer science as well as design, write and test programs using the programming language Java, to solve problems and create new tools.  This course will prepare students for the AP Computer Science A exam.

This is an elective course and is open to students in 10-12th grade who have passed Integrated Math 1 with a C- or better.

### Situation

This class will be provided as an elective and class size will depend on interest 
from students.  Class size can be up to 36 students under normal circumstances.  
Our school does not have the funds to support any additional purchases for this 
class to begin, so the options will either be to use existing technology or to apply 
for a grant.  Every student has been issued a Chromebook and while class could be held
in a lab, software would need to run on Chromebooks to make sure students were able 
to access it from home.  
This course will have a "class within a class" where students will be able to learn 
computer science principles at a lower level, without intending to take the AP test.

## Plan

### Software Specifications

**Aeries Gradebook**  
This class will utilize Aeries Gradebook for attendance and grading.  Students, parents 
and teachers will have access to this so that all parties can keep up to date on grades
and assignments.

**Google Classroom**  
Google classroom will be used for posting assignments and projects to the students and 
keeping students up to date on their grades. It will be used for students to communicate 
with teacher with questions and other communications.  It will be the place where access
to all other class software will be so that students have one place to go to get links,
assginments and communication.

**Scratch**  
For intro to coding principles, students will use scratch.mit.edu.  Students will come 
from a variety of backgrounds and so a few lessons with scratch will help them to see 
visual feedback for their initial coding efforts.  When text-based coding is introduced
teacher will do a side-by-side comparison of things like loops and conditional statements
on Scratch and Java so that students will be able to bridge the gap from their prior
knowledge to Java.

**Code Workout**  
CodeWorkout.cs.vt.edu will be utilized for the majority of learning and developing 
different parts of students coding repertoire, with a focus on Java for the first part 
of the course. As students master Java problets they will begin to expand their 
understanding to other languages.

**GitHub**  
GitHub will be used for 3 projects per semester where students will create a full 
program to design a game, solve a problem and/or create an application for personal use.

### Hardware Specifications

**Teacher Laptop**  
Dell Inspiron, Windows 10 Pro Ed  
Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-10310U CPU @ 1.70GHz   2.21 GHz  
8GB of RAM  
237 GB of storage  

**Teacher Viewboard** Virtual Whiteboard  
DHS-Viewboard-1, Windows 10 Pro  
80" screen  
Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-6400 CPU @ 2.70GH 2.71 GHz  
8.00 GB RAM  
77.2 GB storage

**Student Chromebooks** Various, with at least:  
HP Chromebook 11 G4 Education Edition  
CPU: Intel celeron N2840 Bay Trail Dual Core @2.167 GHx  
GPU: Intel HD 4000 Core @ 792MHz  
4GB RAM  
16GB SSD storage

**Network considerations**  
All of the computers are connected to the school wifi, either on the student or staff 
network.  The wifi is reliable enough and fast enough to accomodate anything, up to
20-30 students watching videos at one time.

The network will block access to sites based on various characteristics, and the 
teacher will need to test all of the academic sites that are novel to this course: 
GitHub, Code Workout and Scratch, to make sure none of them are blocked.  If so, 
a work order will have to be put in to grant permission to the domain and all of 
its subdomains.

Student Chromebooks have sufficent RAM for running all the problets and compiling, 
but they have limited storage capacity so using cloud based technologies was an
important consideration.

### Application

**Intro to Coding via Scratch**  
Students will learn something new (ie. variables, loops, conditionals) and then
they will create a Scratch activity applying that new concept.  Students will start
with Scratch because not all students will have had any prior experience with coding 
so the visual introduction will ensure that all students are able to see the
connections between coding and the resulting actions.

**Transition to Java**  
Once students have mastered the basics of coding, including different types of loops,
different types of conditionals, and use of variables, students will see a side-by-side
comparison of a set of code in Scratch and its corresponding code in Java.  This way
all students will be able to apply their prior block coding knowledge that they have
developed over the introduction to this course, to the new text-based coding they now 
are doing in Java.  Each class period will be similar, with students learning something
new and then doing a problet that helps them apply their knowledge.  As needed, possibly
on a weekly basis, students will have time in class to finish any assignments from the
week that they haven't been able to figure out, and students who are finished can lend
support or explore supplemental assignments to give them an extra challenge.

**Homework**  
Homework will consist of finishing assignments begun in class, with time given
occasionally to students during class to finish up assignments.  Students should have 
the challenge of working through problems without immediately reaching for help, in 
order to create resilient students who know where to look for solutions.  However, 
too much homework will begin to divide the class between those who have stable home
lives with internet access at home and those who don't have this consistently.

**Assessments**  
A few times each semester, students will use GitHub to work on a larger project 
involving a specific prompt, such as creating a game, or solving a problem, or students
can take the opportunity to create code that would be relevant to them personally or 
following a current interest of theirs, provided it incorporates all the required
elements.  Assessment on this will consist of evaluating the finished product, as well
as observing the students during class.  Grades will be based on their independence in
designing the overall flow of the code, their ability to seek out answers to problems,
and their ability to debug their code.

### Impacts

This class will be taught in person, so the technology used will be the technology that 
students and teachers are using to learn, and grade work, instead of technology to primarily
teach or communicate.  These technologies will help all students learn because of the feedback.
The technology gives students feedback so they can immediately see and correct their mistakes
which is a great method to make sure that they are able to be as self-reflective and growth
minded as they want to be.  The technology will also help students because we will be learning
about how to find solutions from each other and across the internet.  Students can access this
information in whatever language they choose, which can help our Spanish ELs that we have in
our school, and also the high number of foreign exchange students that we get from all over
the world.

Other areas of inclusivity will involve making sure that students have access to school wifi
and devices so that they can utilize those outside of class time to finish projects if they 
don't have sufficient access at home.  One of the main ways to help overcome the stigma that 
computer science is for males, will be the fact that it's being taught by a female teacher, 
but also we will focus on our recruiting during registration by focusing on all the things 
that computer science can do in arts, sciences, and even leisure in order to help attract
a balanced population.

In order to create a resilient class, we will spend some time learning about copyright,
which will help students in all their classes, but also we will focus on the learning and 
each person's contribution.  Of course in computer science there is an element of borrowing 
ideas from others, but students will be taught to evaluate their learning so that they can focus 
on what they brought to the project, instead of on completion.  To that end, a major part of 
their grade will have to be focused on what they learned and what they can do with it, 
instead of focusing on getting the task completely done.
